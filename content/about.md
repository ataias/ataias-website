My name is Ataias Pereira Reis and I am from Brazil! Nice to meet you! I am currently a [mechatronics engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics) student at [University of Brasilia](http://unb.br/) who is eager to graduate. Graduation is not far, though, I may graduate mid-2016.

### Some stuff that I have done

Although mechatronics focus in Automation and Control, what I have been really passionate about is programming. There are some mandatory courses I have taken as:


* *Introduction to Programming*, in which I have learned C;
* *Data Structures*, also in C;
* *Computer Organization and Architecture*: learned a great deal of Assembly MIPS and I had to program a ~~broken~~ version of [Arcade Volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Volleyball) to run on an FPGA;
* *Computer Networks*: I discovered that using a sniffer is kind of hard; and
* *Systems Software*: great course also! I was required to make an Assembler of ~~an invented~~ Assembly in C or C++ and I chose C++! I got into C++11 making use of regex and functional programming in every class I could. I also learned makefiles.

Do not think I do computer science classes only when I am coerced to do them! I had taken a couple of electives also, but at McGill University while I was an exchange student there:


* COMP 302 - *Programming Languages and Paradigms*: learned OCaml! Well, I have never used it again since then but I was a really interesting experience as I have never actually understood what functional programing was until then (this was before *Systems Software*). I wouldn't be afraid to try it again, if needed;
* COMP 409 - *Concurrent Programming*: pre-requisite was Java and... I knew ~~nothing~~ a little and I had to dig lots of documentation myself to be able to keep up. I knew C++ beforehand so I wasn't so lost;
* COMP 424 - *Artificial Intelligence*: this was a really involving course that required me to review every single bit of statistics that I had forgot and learn something more. I haven't studied this subject since then, but it is on my waiting list.
* ECSE 421 - *Embedded Systems*: one of the classes I most enjoyed. I reviewed *Computer Organization and Architecture* and learned SystemVerilog.

During my exchange, I was a research assistant under professor [Brett Meyer](http://bhm.ece.mcgill.ca/~bhm/) supervision in the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering, [SURE](http://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/current-students/undergraduate/research), of 2014. He was my professor of ECSE 421, he teaches very well and he is funny.

### What is this page for?

This page is an effort of mine to start diving more into computer science. I am almost graduating and I want to have a career in that field. I just learned HTML and CSS and jumped right in learning [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and its templating scheme and now I am writing here. I want to share what I study of Android and iOS programming here, as well as any programming skills I get or doubts I have. I may also write about Brazilian food haha.

As you may have guessed, I am trying to become a Software Developer and I am starting by learning Android and iOS. Most of the material I have been studying is available for free at [Udacity](udacity.com).
